Glox is an interpreter for the Lox programming language, written in Gleam. Lox is a modern, dynamically-typed language with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

You can get more information about Lox and how to design interpreters at [*crafting interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). This is a great book, thanks to the author Robert Nystrom.

## Overview

Glox aims to provide a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use implementation of the Lox language. It is designed to be highly extensible, allowing developers to easily add new features and functionality.

## Features

- [x] Supports the full Lox language syntax
- [x] Includes a built-in lexer, parser, and interpreter
- [ ] Provides a simple and intuitive API for executing Lox code
- [ ] Highly extensible, with a modular design that makes it easy to add new features

## Usage

To use Glox, simply clone the repository and run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Frid-Yuandu/glox.git
cd glox
gleam run
```

This will start the Glox interpreter in interactive mode, allowing you to execute Lox code directly.

## Documentation (TODO)
